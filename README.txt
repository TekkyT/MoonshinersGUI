======================================================
	Moonshiners GUI Update (HOW TO LAUNCH)

Open MoonshinersGUI/dist (the dist folder inside of MoonshinersGUI folder)

Double click MoonshinersGUI.jar
======================================================
		UPDATE NOTES
You must have java installed to run this game. I recommend installing the latest jdk as well,
since it isn't too large.

Download java and latest jdk from this website, or you can just use google lol
Java jdk:    (make sure you download the correct one for your OS, if you have windows, click windows. Mac, click macOS. Linux, stay on Linux.)

base Java (I recommend just going to the link above but here's this just in case you can't configure jdk)

-------------------------------------------------------------
GAME CONTAINS AS OF NOW:

(almost) fully functional game environment.
only thing missing there is the option to sell your moonshine.

Setup in Java Swing for ease of access and ease of modification.
Player class for ease of modification.

-------------------------------------------------------------
TO BE ADDED

I will be adding a LOT of adventure elements to this game very shortly. 
Remember this is just the framework for the game.
The inspiration for this GUI was obviously the text based adventure game I created, Moonshiners.
I will be adding all of the elements from that game, and more.
Moonshiners text-based is available for download on my github.

I have ideas of one day transforming this game into a 2d open world adventure game. We'll see if I really want to do all that lol 

PS you can do whatever you want with this source, as long as I get some credit in some way. If you create a game out of it, maybe add an easter egg that
informs the user that I inspired the game, I don't know, something creative. Otherwise do whatever you want with it, let me know if you do! I would love to hear about it.
